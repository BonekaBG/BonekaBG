Hey there 👋

I’m Dimitar, a Business Information Systems (BIS) student based in Ireland.

I build systems, apps and web pages with the intent to serve a purpose.
If there’s any problems like a messy process, unclear data, non-functioning code or hardware, or a half-baked idea I like turning it into something structured and usable.

Most of my work lives around:
databases, fullstack development, system design, and applied analytics, user experience design and hardware engineering.

My main stack right now is Python, SQL, Flask, Oracle APEX, and the web basics like HTML, JavaScript, CSS and PHP.
I also have some little experience with languages like C++, C#, Jinja, Bootstrap, SQLAlchemy and Jupyter for AI development and Game Development

I am also extremely interested in Hardware which would include both Computer, Server and Networking. Though I am still learning, I believe I am going at a faster pace than usual.

I’ve worked on a mix of academic and personal projects, but my favourites are the ones that solve actual problems, include automation or improve an already existing item:
PC diagnostics tools, data-driven web apps, and analytics projects that inform decisions instead of decorating dashboards.

I’m less interested in hype or overexaggeration of a product.
More interested in clarity, scalability, and whether the solution holds up under pressure in any possible situation.
I like to make fail-safes for fail-safes.

**Fun Facts**
- I play the guitar, not professionally but I do know a few "Campfire Songs" and a couple of famous songs.
- I practice swimming from time to time. Used to compete professionally but got bored of it.  
- I’d rather say “I don’t know” than bluff or lie because what's the point?  
- I enjoy building things. I am a very practical man, so I love fiddlings with gadgets and tool to figure out how they work/what is their function.

I am actively seeking internships, collaboration, projects and/or jobs that live between
**technology, data, and business reality**, so please feel free to reach out.
