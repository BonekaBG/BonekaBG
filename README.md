Hey there 👋

I’m Dimitar, a Business Information Systems student based in Ireland.

I build systems that sit between business needs and technical reality.
If there’s a messy process, unclear data, or a half-baked idea — I like turning it into something structured and usable.

Most of my work lives around:
databases, backend logic, system design, and applied analytics.
Not just making things run — making them make sense.

My main stack right now is Python, SQL, Flask, Oracle APEX, and the web basics.
I also spend a lot of time thinking about data architecture, networking, and how real users interact with systems.

I’ve worked on a mix of academic and personal projects, but my favourites are the ones that solve actual problems:
PC diagnostics tools, data-driven web apps, and analytics projects that inform decisions instead of decorating dashboards.

I’m less interested in hype.
More interested in clarity, scalability, and whether the solution holds up under pressure.

**Fun Facts**
- I prefer clean logic over clever hacks  
- I document decisions, not just code  
- I’d rather say “I don’t know” than bluff  
- I enjoy building things that outlive the assignment
