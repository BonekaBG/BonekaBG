# Hi, I’m Dimitar 👋

I’m a Business Information Systems student at University College Cork, focused on building practical, business-driven technology — systems that solve real problems, not just coursework demos.

I sit at the intersection of **IT infrastructure, data, and product thinking**:
- I care about how systems are designed
- I care about how data flows and scales
- I care about whether the solution actually works for users and organisations

## What I’m Working On

- **Full-stack and data-driven applications**  
  Python, Flask, SQL, Oracle APEX, HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Systems & infrastructure fundamentals**  
  Networking, databases, security basics, distributed systems  
- **Applied analytics & decision support**  
  Data mining, engagement analysis, business reporting  
- **UX-aware system design**  
  Translating business needs into usable, structured solutions

## How I Work
